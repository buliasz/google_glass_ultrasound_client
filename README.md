Glass USG client
================

This is a USG client application for Google Glass. Using local Wi-Fi network
it connects to the USG server which should be running on the ultrasound 
device and retrieves the current examination image. Furthermore, it allows 
modifying the ultrasound scanner’s parameters by using the Glass’s touchpad 
as well as voice commands.
